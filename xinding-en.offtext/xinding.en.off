^n2 Repentance Verses

Of all my past created evil karmas,
all by beginingless greed, anger and delusion,
from my body, speech and mind as arisen,
now before the Buddha I seek repentance.
Of all my past created evil karmas,
all by beginingless greed, anger and delusion,
from my body, speech and mind as arisen,
For all my sin I seek repentance.
